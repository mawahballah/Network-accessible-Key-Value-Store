# Network accessible Key Value Store

Using Windows Sockets 2, a network-accessible key-value-store server is created. With this application, multiple clients can add/update values by key, retrieve values by key and delete values by key. Data is automatically flushed from the memory to the disk after exceeding the size limit based on a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache.

## Getting Started

Clone/Download the files in this repository


## Testing

Run the server(main.cpp) then run as many clients as you want.
